![EDA Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200?text=Melbourne+Housing+Prices+EDA) <!-- Replace with actual banner image if available -->

## Overview
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Melbourne housing prices dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to property values, locations, and market factors through visualizations and statistical summaries.

**Disclaimer: Data Cleaning Not Done Yet.** This is an ongoing project—expect updates as cleaning and deeper analysis progress.

## Key Sections
- **Data Sources**: Melbourne housing dataset (e.g., CSV from Kaggle or public sources).
- **Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Initial Findings**:
  - High correlation between property size and price.
  - Regional price variations across suburbs.
  - Visualizations: Histograms for price distribution, scatter plots for price vs. distance from CBD, and heatmaps for feature correlations.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run notebooks: Open in Jupyter and execute cells.

## Next Steps
- Complete data cleaning (handling missing values, outliers).
- Add advanced analysis (e.g., regression modeling for price prediction).
- Deploy interactive dashboards (e.g., using Streamlit).
